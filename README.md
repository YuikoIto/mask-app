## face mask app

![1218941497e3e65266b3beb95714052f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43722788/119267078-3216c980-bc28-11eb-8d30-7097726e998a.gif)

[DEMO](https://mask-app-one.vercel.app/)

**This has no loading animation!
So, at the first rendering you have to wait for some seconds!
If you don't see a mask even after 5-6 seconds, I am sorry but just reload it.

This application is developed by using [Tensorflow/face-landmarks-detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/face-landmarks-detection).

## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:YuikoIto/mask-app.git
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
